# Frontend Homework 13

I have finished my thirteenth homework.

Now that I'm back on a somewhat normal schedule, I can finally sleep well.
The homework itself was very easy and enjoyable. Think I did everything well.

The most confusing part was creating the template for the node, where you have to select color.
I wanted to find a way to create the node in javascript without using html templates, but I couldn't do it.
